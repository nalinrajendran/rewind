- This code snippet is responsible for setting up the project.
-
- To get started, follow these steps:
-
- 1.  Run `npm i` in both the server and cli directories to install the required dependencies.
-
- 2.  Set up the MongoDB URI by replacing the placeholder values in the following format:
- `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
- Replace `<username>` with your MongoDB username, `<password>` with your MongoDB password,
- and `<cluster-url>` with the URL of your MongoDB cluster.
-
- Example:
- `mongodb+srv://sde_project:UBDfGrzq8LJNBrOF@cluster0.yrxkwf7.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
-
- 3.  Once the setup is complete, you can proceed with running the project.
